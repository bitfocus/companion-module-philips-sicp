## Philips SICP Module

This module can be used to control Philips Signage displays.
The module has been tested with Philips 86BDL3511Q, 
but should be compatible with other displays supporting 
SERIAL / ETHERNET INTERFACE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL v1.99

To start the display with the module, TCP should always be available.
Or Wake On LAN should be enabled on both the display and the module config.
